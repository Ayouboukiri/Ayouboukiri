    <p>
        Chess is a two-player strategy board game that is played on an 
        8x8 grid called a chessboard. It is one of the most popular and
         enduring games in the world, known for its deep 
        complexity and strategic depth. The game is played between two opponents,
         often referred to as "white" and "black," who take turns moving their pieces 
         with the goal of capturing the opponent's king. The player who puts the opponent's
          king in a position from which it cannot escape is said to have achieved checkmate, 
          and they win the game.
    </p>
       <div ><h2 class="chess_title2">Objective</h2></div>
    <p>
        The primary objective of chess is to checkmate your opponent's king
        . This means putting the king in a position where it is under attack and cannot escape capture.
    </p>
     <div ><h2 class="chess_title3">Check and Checkmate</h2></div>
    <p>
        Check: When a player's king is un
        der threat of capture, they are in ch
        eck. The player must make a move to remove the threat. </p>
    <p>
        Checkmate: If a player's king is in check,
        and there is no legal move they can ma
        ke to get out of check, they are in checkmate, and the game is over.
